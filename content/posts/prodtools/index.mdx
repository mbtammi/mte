# What are the best tools?

There are multiple tools to improve and help with your productivity. I will be going through the most common ones and the ones that are the easiest to implement in your daily life

I have realized that all the tools I use need to be easy access and work well. Having tried out multiple different tools these are some of my favourite. 

## Todoist or a ToDo app
Never worry about forgetting those small tasks anymore. Take a simple ToDo -app into your daily life and ease your brainload. Having to remember those small tasks can be overwhelming and usually you always forget that one task.
Benefits of an app like Todoist is that you can have it on multiple devices. Whenever I remember something I need to get done I just instantly mark it on Todoist. Therefore I'm always on top of my tasks and not the other way around
Set yourself daily goals like completing 4 tasks for example and enjoy the satisfaction of completing those. 

## Calendar
Write done your schedule now if you haven't already. Mark important meetings in the calendar and try to keep it completely empty after 6 pm. It's very important to make sure you rest efficiently.
Having all of your goings on your calendar rests your brain more, since you don't have to worry about remember all the times and places. In productivity it's important to make sure to take load off your brain and aim the energy at actually doing the tasks and activities.

## Dream map / ToDo spreadsheet
I have developed a personalized spreadsheet for a whole year and put my goals in there and important ToDos. I use this more as a long goal tool. Make the goals early in the year and you will always know what you are going towards. Let it be a new certificate or completing a major school assingment for example.
If you have any questions about making you a personal productivity plan feel free to contact me!

## Notes on the phone on the go
Need to make a quick shopping list, or want to write a message ready on the go. Make sure to utilize all the tools around you. I mostly use this for a bit longer ToDos or shopping lists for example.

## Pen and paper
The old-fashioned way or still a stable way? This is really good for some since you physically see the note and that works your brain in a different way. 
You can never go wrong with post-it notes. These are also a really good way to teach a friend about something and the saying goes: when you teach you learn.

Everybody is completely different and some of these might not work but for some these are lifesaving. Give it a try and let me know how you feel about these and if there is some you think are really good.
