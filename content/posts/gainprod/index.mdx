# So, how to actually gain productivity?

I wanted to write in a list-like manner for you to pin the most beneficial ways to you.

## Set goals and prioritize your tasks:
Start your day by setting clear goals and prioritizing your to-do list. This will help you stay focused and motivated throughout the day.

## Eliminate distractions 
Identify and eliminate distractions that can hinder your productivity, such as social media, email notifications, and messaging apps. You can use apps like Freedom or Focus@Will to help you stay focused.

## Take breaks 
Taking short breaks can actually help improve productivity. Try the Pomodoro Technique - working for 25 minutes, then taking a 5-minute break. Repeat the cycle 4 times, then take a longer break.

## Exercise 
Incorporate exercise into your daily routine. Exercise can help improve your mood, energy levels, and overall productivity.

## Eat a healthy diet 
A healthy diet can help improve energy levels and concentration. Eating healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, proteins, and complex carbohydrates can help improve productivity.

## Use productivity tools
There are several productivity tools available that can help you stay on track and manage your time effectively. Tools like Trello, Todoist, and Google Calendar can help you stay organized and focused.

## Make time for self-care 
Taking care of yourself is necessary for productivity. Make sure to get enough sleep, rest when needed, and participate in hobbies and activities that rejuvenate and energize you.

By following these tips, you can improve your productivity and achieve your goals with less stress and more satisfaction.
